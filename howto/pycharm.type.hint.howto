def foo():
    #: :type: ObservablePlanarGraph

For input variables (in a docstring):
def foo(self, feature_finder):
    """
    :type feature_finder FeatureFinder
    """

For return types (also note, tuples and lists):

def foo(self):
    """
    :rtype (list[PolicyData], list[PolicyData])
    """
    return res
